## Ver 2.1: DQP with interpolation over 1-dimensional covariate space (spline center)

Extended version of DQP implementation. DQP is constructed at pre-determined locations on a covariate space. Quantiles are interpolated over the covariate space. 
The centering transformation is based on spline regression.
